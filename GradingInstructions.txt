#After each submission, download the submission from iLearn

cd ~/Downloads
extract.zsh ReplaceThisWithNameOfDownloadedFile.zip

# that command should have made ~/Labs/CS160/Grade with
# a submission for each student by email address

cd ~/Labs/CS160
# this will move files to the appropriate Week?? directory
~/Capital/CS160/HomeworkForVideos5/Week??/mvForTheseFiles.zsh

# must do those commands for each submission separately 
# download from iLearn
# extract.zsh
# mvScript.zsh

# after doing this for each weekly submission, you are ready
# to run the script that tests their files

cd ~/Labs/CS160

# this runs the test script
~/Capital/CS160/HomeworkForVideos5/Week??/rd.zsh

# this uploads to codepost.io
~/Capital/CS160/HomeworkForVideos5/Week??/cpUpload.zsh
